Itâ€™s that time of the year again to express our gratitude for the dedication and hard work of our faculty and staff! On behalf of SGSA, I am thrilled to extend a warm invitation to you all for our annual Faculty and Staff Appreciation BBQ at Pavilion A of Tiffany Park on Saturday, April 13 from 4:00 to 7:00 PM.

Tiffany Park offers a range of amenities including volleyball and basketball courts, space for soccer, cricket, frisbees, and playgrounds for children, and is pet-friendly. We hope all of you will join us for an enjoyable evening of BBQ and outdoor games.
